/*************************************************************************
    This is the file smalloc.c, it includes the function mem_init(size), smalloc (),
    sfree (), and mem_clean (). These function create a custom function that
    works like malloc and free.

    mem_init (size) -> memory initialize, initialize the memory block of size,
    giving the address to mem. Also store it in the freelist.
    This block is store in freelist which give the address of the data block
    and the size of the block. This also initialize the emty allocated_list.
    If the function fails it return NULL.

    smalloc (nbytes) -> small memory allocate, goes in to the freelist 
    and finds block that match the size. If there is no block the same size,
    it will tries to find a block with a larger size and divide it into the wanted
    byte size and free block. It will store the allocated block address in the 
    alloca_list and put the new address of the free bolck back to the freelist, as
    a linked list. If the function fails it returns NULL.

      *** Problem that might arrise ***
      Three freelist might be a long linked list of small block, like 1 bytes, cause by 
      sfree (). At this point the function behaves as if there is not space and return NULL.
      The smalloc will not mearge the small blocks that is continous.

    sfree (addr)  -> small free, puts the Block back to the freelist letting smalloc to allcate 
    this block again. It will not mearge any blocks that is continuous.

    mem_clean () -> memory clean, cleans the block from mem_init from by the address mem. 
    Using the free () function.

/* Initialize the memory space used by smalloc,

 * Note:  mmap is a system call that has a wide variety of uses.  In our
 * case we are using it to allocate a large region of memory. 
 * - mmap returns a pointer to the allocated memory
 * Arguments:
 * - NULL: a suggestion for where to place the memory. We will let the 
 *         system decide where to place the memory.
 * - PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE: we will use the memory for both reading
 *         and writing.
 * - MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON: the memory is just for this process, and 
 *         is not associated with a file.
 * - -1: because this memory is not associated with a file, the file 
 *         descriptor argument is set to -1
 * - 0: only used if the address space is associated with a file.
